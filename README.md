# Drone-Package-System
A drone packaging system project done with 3 other students. This code generates a low poly 3d Model of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities and contains drones picking up packages from multiple places around the university and delivering them to defined destinations. Drones can be generated using the factory method and many drones and packages can be created.
